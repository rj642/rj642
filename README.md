## Hi there, I'm [Rahul Jha](https://github.com/rj642) ðŸ‘‹

&nbsp;

I'm primarily an Android Developer and along with that I can code in Swift, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Python, Golang, C/C++, Dart, and few more . I'm a fullstack developer who can create frontend along with backend and that too with a neat UI and a scalable backend.

### ðŸ˜ƒ About me
- I like things more **Native** than crossed.
- I mostly develop apps which I think as a possible solution to current problems.
- Scrawling through Stackoverflow is basically everyone's job so does mine!
- Updating with a newer tech stacks and architectural component is what makes me more curious ðŸ™‚
