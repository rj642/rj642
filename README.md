## Hi there, I'm [Rahul Jha](https://github.com/rj642) 👋

&nbsp;

I'm primarily an Android Application Developer 💻 and also learning ML concepts to implement a working model into my upcoming application, good with beginner friendly ReactNative 🌐, more repository in sub-domain is under development.

### 😃 About me
- I like things more **Native** then crossed.
- I mostly develop apps which I think as a possible solution to current problems (Coming Soon).
- Scrawling through Stackoverflow is basically everyone's job so does mine!
- Updating with a newer tech stacks and architectural component is what makes me more curious 🙂
